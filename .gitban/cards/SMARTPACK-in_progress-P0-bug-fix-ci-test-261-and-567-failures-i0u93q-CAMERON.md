## Bug Description

### What's Broken

Two BATS tests fail on macOS CI after the SMARTPACK sprint renamed `active_pack` to `default_pack` and added path_rules status output.

**Test 261** (`tests/opencode.bats:126`): Asserts `c['active_pack']` but the OpenCode adapter's config template now uses `default_pack`. The template was updated (line 106 of `adapters/opencode.sh` shows `"default_pack": "peon"`), but the test assertion still references the old key name.

**Test 567** (`tests/peon.bats:3679`): `status shows active path rule when cwd matches` — the assertion `[[ "$output" == *"path rules: 1 configured"* ]]` fails. The status Python block at `peon.sh:945-957` should print both `"path rule: * -> sc_kerrigan"` and `"path rules: 1 configured"`, but CI output suggests the second line is missing. The test binds with `--pattern "*"` which may cause shell or fnmatch edge cases on macOS CI.

### Expected Behavior

Both tests should pass. Test 261 should validate `default_pack` (the current config key). Test 567's status output should include the "path rules: N configured" summary line.

### Actual Behavior

Test 261: `KeyError: 'active_pack'` — Python assertion fails because the key no longer exists in the config.

Test 567: Assertion `[[ "$output" == *"path rules: 1 configured"* ]]` fails. BATS output shows `peon-ping: bound sc_kerrigan to *` as the only captured output context. The "path rules: 1 configured" line is absent from status output.

### Reproduction Rate

* [x] 100% - Always reproduces

## Steps to Reproduce

**Prerequisites:**
* macOS CI environment (macos-latest)
* bats-core installed

**Reproduction Steps:**

1. Check out `sprint/SMARTPACK` branch
2. Run `bats tests/opencode.bats` — test 261 fails with `KeyError: 'active_pack'`
3. Run `bats tests/peon.bats` — test 567 fails on "path rules: 1 configured" assertion

**Error Messages / Stack Traces:**

```
# Test 261:
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<string>", line 4, in <module>
# KeyError: 'active_pack'

# Test 567:
#   `[[ "$output" == *"path rules: 1 configured"* ]]' failed
# peon-ping: bound sc_kerrigan to *
```

## Root Cause Investigation

| Iteration # | Hypothesis | Test/Action Taken | Outcome / Findings |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Test 261 still references old `active_pack` key | Read `tests/opencode.bats:126` — confirms `assert c['active_pack']` | Root cause confirmed — key was renamed to `default_pack` but test not updated |
| **2** | Test 567 status output missing path_rules line | Read `peon.sh:945-957` — code looks correct; read CI output — status output truncated | Needs investigation — may be Python crash, shell quoting issue with `*` pattern, or fnmatch edge case |

---

### Hypothesis testing iterations

**Iteration 1:** Test 261 — stale key reference

**Hypothesis:** The SMARTPACK sprint renamed `active_pack` to `default_pack` in the OpenCode adapter config template but didn't update the test assertion.

**Test/Action Taken:** Read `adapters/opencode.sh:106` — shows `"default_pack": "peon"`. Read `tests/opencode.bats:126` — shows `assert c['active_pack'] == 'peon'`.

**Outcome:** Confirmed. The config template was updated but the test assertion still uses the old key name.

---

**Iteration 2:** Test 567 — missing status output line

**Hypothesis:** The status command's Python block at `peon.sh:945-957` should print "path rules: N configured" but something prevents it from reaching that line when `--pattern "*"` is used.

**Test/Action Taken:** Read the Python code — the `print` at line 957 is outside the `if _matched:` block and inside the `if rules:` block, so it should always print when rules exist. CI output only shows `peon-ping: bound sc_kerrigan to *` which is the bind confirmation, not status output.

**Outcome:** Root cause not fully determined from static analysis. Possible causes: (a) Python crash between lines 956-957, (b) the `*` glob pattern causing issues in BATS shell quoting, (c) status command exiting before reaching path_rules section. Executor should reproduce locally and trace the actual output.

---

### Root Cause Summary

**Root Cause:**

**Test 261:** `tests/opencode.bats:126` asserts `c['active_pack']` but the config key was renamed to `default_pack` during the SMARTPACK sprint. The assertion was missed during the rename sweep.

**Test 567:** Status output is missing the "path rules: N configured" summary line. The Python code at `peon.sh:957` should print it unconditionally when `rules` is non-empty, but CI shows it's absent. Executor must reproduce and trace the actual failure.

**Code/Config Location:**

- `tests/opencode.bats:126` — `active_pack` assertion
- `tests/peon.bats:3673-3680` — status path_rules assertion
- `peon.sh:945-957` — status path_rules Python block

**Why This Happened:**

Test 261: The config key rename from `active_pack` to `default_pack` missed this test assertion. Test 567: New feature (path_rules status display) may have an edge case with wildcard patterns or a flow issue not caught by local testing.

---

## Solution Design

### Fix Strategy

**Test 261:** Change `c['active_pack']` to `c['default_pack']` at `tests/opencode.bats:126`.

**Test 567:** Reproduce locally, trace the actual `peon status` output when a `--pattern "*"` rule exists, and fix either the test expectation or the status code as appropriate.

### Code Changes

* `tests/opencode.bats:126` — Update assertion from `active_pack` to `default_pack`
* `tests/peon.bats:3673-3680` and/or `peon.sh:945-957` — Fix based on local reproduction

### Rollback Plan

These are test-only changes. Rollback is a simple revert.

## Executor Work Summary

**Commit:** `3878c19` — `fix: resolve CI test 261 and 567 failures`

**Test 261 fix** (`tests/opencode.bats:126`):
Changed `assert c['active_pack'] == 'peon'` to `assert c['default_pack'] == 'peon'`. The SMARTPACK sprint renamed the config key but the test assertion was missed during the rename sweep.

**Test 567 fix** (`peon.sh:956`):
The status command's `python3 -c "..."` block contained an f-string with double-quoted dict access: `_matched["pattern"]`. Because the entire Python code is inside a bash double-quoted string (`python3 -c "..."`), the inner double quotes around `"pattern"` and `"pack"` broke the shell quoting. Bash stripped the quotes, causing Python to receive `_matched[pattern]` (an undefined variable reference) instead of `_matched["pattern"]` (a string key lookup). This raised a NameError, preventing the "path rules: N configured" line from being printed.

Fix: extracted dict values into local variables using `.get()` (which uses single quotes, safe inside bash double-quoted strings), then referenced the variables in the f-string:
```python
_mp = _matched.get('pattern', '')
_mk = _matched.get('pack', '')
print(f'peon-ping: path rule: {_mp} -> {_mk}')
```
