# Harden Windows atomic state I/O edge cases

**When to use this template:** Technical debt hardening for Windows PowerShell state I/O in `install.ps1` (embedded `peon.ps1` hook).

---

## Required Reading

| File / Area | What to Look For |
| :--- | :--- |
| `install.ps1` line 800 | `Write-StateAtomic` function definition — current delete-then-move pattern |
| `install.ps1` lines 935, 1069 | Call sites of `Write-StateAtomic` — state persistence after event processing |
| `install.ps1` safety timer code | `[Environment]::Exit(1)` usage — skips `finally` blocks |
| Card z0c9fd (archived) | SMARTPACK review that flagged both edge cases |
| Card 26yooi (backlog) | Related Write-StateAtomic upgrade — blocked on PS 5.1 drop, do NOT implement the 3-arg Move here |
| Card lyq5ta (backlog, HOOKBUG) | Related state helper DRY-up — coordinate to avoid conflicts |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] L1: `Write-StateAtomic` adds a PS version check — on PS 7+ uses `Move-Item -Force` (atomic overwrite) instead of delete-then-move
- [x] L2: Safety timer exit path either switches to `exit 1` (runs trap handlers) or adds `.tmp` cleanup on next startup in `Read-StateWithRetry`
- [x] Pester tests pass (`Invoke-Pester -Path tests/adapters-windows.Tests.ps1`)
- [x] No regression in existing state management behavior on PS 5.1 (delete-then-move path preserved)

## Task Overview

* **Task Description:** Harden two edge cases in the Windows PowerShell state management code (`Write-StateAtomic` and safety timer) within the embedded `peon.ps1` hook in `install.ps1`.
* **Motivation:** Reviewer flagged two non-blocking reliability gaps during the SMARTPACK sprint (card z0c9fd review). Both are low-risk but worth hardening for correctness.
* **Scope:** `install.ps1` — embedded `peon.ps1` hook code, specifically `Write-StateAtomic` and the safety timer exit path.
* **Related Work:** Flagged during SMARTPACK sprint review of card z0c9fd. Related to archived card kydihy (atomic state writes) and backlog card lyq5ta (state helper DRY-up).
* **Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

**Required Checks:**
* [x] **Task description** clearly states what needs to be done.
* [x] **Motivation** explains why this work is necessary.
* [x] **Scope** defines what will be changed.

## Work Log

Track the execution of this chore task step by step.

| Step | Status/Details | Universal Check |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **1. Review Current State** | Two edge cases identified in review: (L1) non-atomic window in `Write-StateAtomic` between `[IO.File]::Delete` and `[IO.File]::Move`; (L2) safety timer uses `[Environment]::Exit(1)` which skips `finally` blocks and may leave `.tmp` files | - [x] Current state is understood and documented. |
| **2. Plan Changes** | L1: Add PS version check — on PS 7+ use `Move-Item -Force` (truly atomic, overwrites target) instead of delete-then-move. L2: Add `.tmp` cleanup on next startup in `Read-StateWithRetry`. | - [x] Change plan is documented. |
| **3. Make Changes** | L1: `Write-StateAtomic` now branches on `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -ge 7`. L2: `Read-StateWithRetry` scans for `$base.*.tmp` glob and removes orphans before retry loop. Commit `b31ed71`. | - [x] Changes are implemented. |
| **4. Test/Verify** | 3 new Pester tests added; full suite passes 207/207. | - [x] Changes are tested/verified. |
| **5. Update Documentation** | N/A — internal implementation detail | - [x] Documentation is updated [if applicable]. |
| **6. Review/Merge** | Pending review | - [ ] Changes are reviewed and merged. |

#### Work Notes

> **Item L1 — Non-atomic window in `Write-StateAtomic`:**
> `Write-StateAtomic` currently does `[IO.File]::Delete($target)` then `[IO.File]::Move($tmp, $target)`. There is a sub-millisecond window where the target does not exist. On PowerShell 7+, `Move-Item -Force` performs an atomic overwrite. Add a `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -ge 7` check to use the safer path when available.
>
> **Item L2 — Safety timer skips `finally` blocks:**
> The safety timer fires `[Environment]::Exit(1)` which bypasses `finally` blocks and cleanup. If state has been partially written, this could leave a `.tmp` file behind. Two options: (a) switch to `exit 1` which runs trap handlers, or (b) add a `.tmp` file cleanup check at the start of `Read-StateWithRetry` on next invocation.

**Decisions Made:**
* Both items are low-risk hardening (sub-millisecond race window, rare timeout scenario) but worth fixing for correctness.

**Issues Encountered:**
* None yet — work not started.

## Execution Summary

**Commit:** `b31ed71` on branch `worktree-agent-a3fbb13a`

**Changes made:**

1. **L1 -- PS 7+ atomic overwrite in `Write-StateAtomic`** (`install.ps1` line 580): Added `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -ge 7` branch that uses `Move-Item -Path $tmp -Destination $Path -Force` for a truly atomic overwrite with no delete gap. The PS 5.1 delete-then-move fallback is preserved in the else branch.

2. **L2 -- Orphaned `.tmp` cleanup in `Read-StateWithRetry`** (`install.ps1` line 595): Added a cleanup block at the start of `Read-StateWithRetry` that scans for `$base.*.tmp` files in the state directory and removes them. This guards against partial writes left behind when the safety timer fires `[Environment]::Exit(1)`, which skips `finally` blocks.

3. **3 new Pester tests** (`tests/adapters-windows.Tests.ps1`): Verify PS 7+ branch exists, PS 5.1 fallback is preserved, and `.tmp` cleanup logic is present.

**Test results:** 207/207 Pester tests pass (0 failures).

**No follow-up work needed** -- card lyq5ta (state helper DRY-up) is a separate concern and does not conflict with these changes.
